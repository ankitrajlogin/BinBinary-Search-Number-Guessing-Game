# Binary Search Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Binary Search Number Guessing Game! This interactive game challenges you to guess a number chosen by the computer using the power of binary search. It's a fun and educational way to understand how binary search works!

## How to Play

1. **Enter the Range:** Start by entering two numbers to define the range within which the computer will pick a random number. For example, if you enter 1 and 100, the computer will select a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

2. **Computer Picks a Number:** The computer will randomly choose a number within the range you provided. This number remains hidden, and your goal is to guess it.

3. **Start Guessing:** Using the principles of binary search, make your first guess. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

4. **Narrow Down the Range:** Based on the feedback (higher or lower), adjust your next guess to narrow down the possible numbers.

5. **Exact Guesses:** You will have exactly \(\log_2(N)\) guesses to find the computer's number, where \(N\) is the size of the range you provided. For instance, if your range is from 1 to 100, you will have \(\log_2(100) \approx 7\) guesses.

6. **Win or Lose:** If you guess the number within the allotted guesses, you win! If not, the game reveals the number, and you can try again.
